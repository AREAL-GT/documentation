Basic Indoor Motion-Capture Flights
===================================
This directory contains video and flight logs from various indoor
demonstration flights using motion-capture feedback. These flights were 
performed using PX4 offboard control with position setpoints sent by ROS 2. 
The repository includes video of a circular flight and a waypoint flight. 
There is also the PX4 log from a different (but similar) waypoint flight test.

We are working on performing a few more flights so that matching video, PX4, 
VICON, and any other log files can be uploaded for each trial.
