Welcome to AREAL's External Documentation!
==========================================

**AREAL** stands for Aerial Robotics and Experimental Autonomy Lab. We are 
a part of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. 

This website hosts documentation and descriptions associated with repositories
on the `AREAL External GitHub <https://github.com/AREAL-GT>`_. This is the 
**External** version of the documentation website. All links (should) lead to 
pages and repositories on the external GitHub organization (unless otherwise 
stated in text or comments near them).

.. note::

   These documentation pages and their underlying repositories are possibly
   under development. Each repository description page should have a permanent
   email address for contacting the repository author, maintainer, or someone
   else in the lab. The issue trackers should also be enabled for most of the
   described content repositories and the repository this documentation is 
   generated from. 
   
   While none of the code published by this lab should be 
   considered "regularly supported" per say, we are happy to hear from anyone 
   with questions or to try and fix any bugs that might show up.
